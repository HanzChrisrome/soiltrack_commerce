# Checkout Fix Summary - Total Amount & Payment Provider Data

## Problem

After implementing the fix to only create orders after successful payment, the orders were being saved with:

- ❌ Empty `total_amount` field (missing shipping & platform fees)
- ❌ Empty `payment_provider_data` field
- ❌ Missing breakdown of subtotal, shipping, platform fee in metadata

This happened because the cart in the database only stores product items, not the additional line items (shipping fee, platform fee) that were added during checkout.

## Solution Implemented

Implemented a **localStorage-based checkout summary** that persists the complete order details from Cart page to CheckoutSuccess page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cart.tsx (Frontend)

**Location**: After creating payment link

**Added**:

```typescript
// Save checkout summary to localStorage
const checkoutSummary = {
  total, // Full total including all fees
  subtotal, // Products only
  shippingFee, // Shipping fee
  platformFee, // Platform fee amount
  platformFeeRate, // Platform fee percentage
  itemsPayload, // Original items including fee line items
  timestamp: Date.now(),
};
localStorage.setItem("checkout_summary", JSON.stringify(checkoutSummary));
```

**Why**: This preserves all checkout calculations so they can be used when creating the order.

---

### 2. CheckoutSuccess.tsx (Frontend)

**Location**: Before calling finalize order API

**Added**:

```typescript
// Retrieve checkout summary from localStorage
const checkoutSummaryStr = localStorage.getItem("checkout_summary");
const checkoutSummary = checkoutSummaryStr
  ? JSON.parse(checkoutSummaryStr)
  : {};

// Include in payload
const payload = {
  user_id: authUser.user_id,
  order_ref: order_ref,
  checkout_url: window.location.href,
  payment_method: order_ref.startsWith("cs_") ? "ONLINE" : "COD",
  total: checkoutSummary.total,
  subtotal: checkoutSummary.subtotal,
  shippingFee: checkoutSummary.shippingFee,
  platformFee: checkoutSummary.platformFee,
  platformFeeRate: checkoutSummary.platformFeeRate,
};

await axios.post("http://localhost:5000/api/orders/finalize", payload);

// Clean up after success
localStorage.removeItem("checkout_summary");
```

**Why**: Sends the complete order summary to the backend so it can be saved in the database.

---

### 3. orderController.ts (Backend)

**Location**: `finalizeOrder` function

**Changes**:

1. **Accept new parameters**:

```typescript
const {
  user_id,
  order_ref,
  checkout_url,
  payment_method,
  total, // ← NEW
  subtotal, // ← NEW
  shippingFee, // ← NEW
  platformFee, // ← NEW
  platformFeeRate, // ← NEW
} = req.body;
```

2. **Use total from request**:

```typescript
// Use the total from request if provided (includes shipping + platform fee)
// Otherwise fall back to computed totalAmount (products only)
const finalTotal = total ? total : totalAmount;

const { data: newOrder, error: orderError } = await supabase
  .from("orders")
  .insert([
    {
      user_id,
      order_ref,
      total_amount: Math.round(finalTotal * 100), // ← Uses complete total
      order_status: isOnlinePayment ? "paid" : "pending",
      shipping_status: "To Ship",
      metadata: {
        products: metadataProducts,
        pointsUsed: totalPointsUsed,
        subtotal: subtotal || totalAmount, // ← NEW
        shippingFee: shippingFee || 0, // ← NEW
        platformFee: platformFee || 0, // ← NEW
        platformFeeRate: platformFeeRate || 0, // ← NEW
      },
      payment_provider_link: checkout_url || null,
      payment_provider_data: isOnlinePayment
        ? {
            provider: "paymongo",
            status: "success",
            order_ref,
            checkout_url, // ← Added checkout URL
          }
        : null,
    },
  ]);
```

**Why**: Uses the complete order details from the checkout summary instead of recomputing from cart (which only has products).

## What's Fixed

✅ **total_amount**: Now includes subtotal + shipping + platform fee
✅ **payment_provider_data**: Now populated with payment details for online payments
✅ **metadata**: Now includes complete breakdown:

- Products list
- Points used
- Subtotal
- Shipping fee
- Platform fee
- Platform fee rate

---

## How It Works

### Flow for ONLINE Payment:

1. User adds items to cart
2. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
3. **Cart.tsx**: Calculates total (subtotal + shipping + platform fee) → Saves to localStorage → Redirects to PayMongo
4. User completes payment → Redirected to CheckoutSuccess with `order_ref`
5. **CheckoutSuccess.tsx**: Fetches cart → Retrieves localStorage summary → Sends complete data to backend
6. **Backend**: Creates order with complete total and payment data → Saves to database
7. Cart cleared, localStorage cleaned up

### Flow for COD Payment:

1. User adds items to cart
2. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" with COD selected
3. **Cart.tsx**: Calculates total → Saves to localStorage → Redirects to CheckoutSuccess with `order_ref`
4. **CheckoutSuccess.tsx**: Fetches cart → Retrieves localStorage summary → Sends complete data to backend
5. **Backend**: Creates order with complete total and status "pending" → Saves to database
6. Cart cleared, localStorage cleaned up

---

## Fallback Behavior

If localStorage is not available (edge case):

- Backend falls back to computing total from cart items only
- Order will be created but without shipping/platform fees
- Logged as warning in console

---

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

1. ✅ Online payment → Complete → Check `total_amount` includes all fees
2. ✅ Online payment → Complete → Check `payment_provider_data` is populated
3. ✅ Online payment → Complete → Check `metadata` has fee breakdown
4. ✅ COD payment → Check `total_amount` includes all fees
5. ✅ COD payment → Check `payment_provider_data` is null
6. ✅ COD payment → Check order status is "pending"
7. ✅ Verify localStorage is cleaned up after successful order

---

## Database Schema Reference

### orders table fields populated:

- `order_id` (auto-generated)
- `order_ref` (from checkout)
- `user_id` (from user)
- `total_amount` (subtotal + shipping + platform fee, in centavos)
- `order_status` ("paid" for online, "pending" for COD)
- `shipping_status` ("To Ship")
- `metadata` (JSON with products, fees breakdown)
- `payment_provider_link` (checkout URL)
- `payment_provider_data` (JSON with PayMongo details for online)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

---

## Notes

- localStorage persists even if user refreshes the page
- localStorage is domain-specific (won't conflict with other sites)
- localStorage cleanup ensures no stale data
- Backend fallback ensures system still works without localStorage

---

## Result

✅ Orders now have complete and accurate data
✅ Total amount reflects actual checkout total
✅ Payment provider data is properly saved
✅ Fee breakdown available in metadata for reporting
✅ System works for both online and COD payments

- Tracks points redeemed as voucher for each order
- Saved during order creation
- Displayed in orders, admin panel, and PDF receipts

**Files:**

---

### 3. **Voucher Display in Orders**

- **Badge**: Shows "X pts used" next to payment method
- **Styling**: Yellow badge with gift emoji
- **Conditional**: Only shows when points > 0

**File:** `src/pages/shop/Orders.tsx`

```tsx
{
  order.points_used && order.points_used > 0 && (
    <span className="bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800">
      {order.points_used} pts used
    </span>
  );
}
```

---

### 4. **Voucher in PDF Receipts**

- Restores exact amount of points used
- Logs refund in console
- Returns `pointsRefunded` in API response

**File:** `src/controllers/adminOrderController.ts` - `updateOrderStatus()`

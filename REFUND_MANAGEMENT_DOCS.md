# Refund Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created a comprehensive refund management page for admins to review, approve, or reject refund requests from customers. The UI matches the ManageOrders page design for consistency.

## Files Created

### 1. **Zustand Store** (`src/store/useRefundsStore.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Centralized state management for refund requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches all refund requests with related order and user data
  - Approves refund requests (updates status to "Approved" and order to "Refunded")
  - Rejects refund requests (updates status to "Rejected" and order back to "Received")
  - Stores admin notes for each decision
- **Interface**: `RefundRequest`
  ```typescript
  {
    refund_id: string;
    order_id: string;
    user_id: string;
    reason: string;
    status: string; // "Pending" | "Approved" | "Rejected"
    admin_notes?: string | null;
    created_at: string;
    orders?: {...}; // Related order with items
    users?: {...};  // Customer information
  }
  ```

### 2. **Refund Management Page** (`src/pages/Admin/ManageRefunds.tsx`)

    - Refund Reason (truncated)
    - Status (Pending/Approved/Rejected with color badges)

       - Displays refund reason
       - Optional admin notes field
       - Confirmation required before action

### 3. **Route Configuration** (`src/routes/AdminRoutes.tsx`)

- Added route: `/admin/view-refund-request` → `<ManageRefunds />`
- Protected by `RoleProtectedRoute` (admin only)

## Database Schema Reference

Based on `order_refunds` table:

```

```
